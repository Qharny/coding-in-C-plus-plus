# Password Strength Checker

This Python program allows users to check the strength of their passwords based on certain criteria. It evaluates passwords and categorizes them as weak, average, strong, or secure, providing valuable feedback on their security level.

## Features

- **Password Complexity Analysis**: The program analyzes the complexity of the entered password based on factors such as length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols.

- **Scoring System**: Passwords are scored using a comprehensive system that takes into account various elements, including length, character types, and combinations, to determine their strength.

- **User Interaction**: Users can interactively input passwords and receive immediate feedback on the strength of their passwords.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The program provides a clear and easy-to-understand interface, making it accessible to users of all levels.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program**: Execute the Python script in a Python environment.

2. **Input Password**: Enter the password you want to evaluate when prompted.

3. **View Strength**: The program will display the strength of the entered password as weak, average, strong, or secure.

4. **Regenerate Password (Optional)**: If desired, the program allows users to generate another password by pressing 'y'. If not, press any other key to exit.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed. If not, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How the Program Works

The program calculates the strength of the password using a scoring system. It considers various factors such as length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, symbols, and their combinations. The final score determines the password's strength level.
